Tracking the consequences of environmental change requires information on both the physical and biological characteristics of ecological systems. Large-scale environmental data are now widely available from many data repositories. However, these data sets often need to be down-scaled in order to be paired with local ecological measurements. Hence, micro-environmental sensors are sometimes useful to integrate scales of ecological information relevant to global change. In this workshop, we will demonstrate the use of all major affordable types of micro-environmental sensors available to collect fine-scale environmental data. Using the R environment, we will also provide the means to analyze these data and also to integrate this information with ecological data and macro-environmental data streams. The overall purpose of this workshop is to provide attendees with hands on experience on the use of automated sensors of micro-environmental variables, their appropriate deployment in the field in relation to ecological questions, and an introduction to the integration of micro-scale data to larger environmental datasets. This is an open-source, collaborative network of micro-environmental sensors deployed globally. More information about micronet and uploading protocol can be found at http://micronet.io/
